# About Me

Hello, I’m **Jaeseong Kwon**, a researcher and engineer deeply engaged in **compiler testing**, **software security** and **program analysis**. 


## Academic Journey
- **Master’s Student** in **Information Security** at [KAIST](https://prosys.kaist.ac.kr) (ProsysLab), graduating in **Feb 2025**.
- **Bachelor’s Degree** in **Cyber Defense** from **Korea University**, graduated in **Feb 2023**.

## What I Do
I have a deep interest in **understanding, analyzing, and improving compilers**. Lately, I’ve been conducting various research projects on **compiler testing**, focusing on **optimization verification** and **translation validation**. I find joy in dissecting the internal structures of compilers, understanding their mechanisms, and exploring innovative ways to ensure their correctness and reliability.
In my previous work, we discovered 55 new miscompilation bugs in latest LLVM.

## Publications
- **["Translation Validation for JIT Compiler in the V8 JavaScript Engine"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3597503.3639189)** (2nd Author), presented at **ICSE 2024**.
- **"Optimization-Directed Compiler Fuzzing"** (1st Author), currently under review at **PLDI 2025**.

## Work Experience
- **[ENKI](https://www.enki.co.kr/en/)** (2022): Worked as a **Security Researcher** in the Research Team, focusing on **vulnerability analysis**, **reverse engineering**, and **software security.**

## Project Highlights
- **Optimization-Directed Compiler Fuzzing**: Leveraging fuzzing to enhance continuous translation validation.
- **Translation Validation for JIT Compiler**: Focused on ensuring correctness in the V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Compiler Optimizations Verification**: Using theorem provers to verify compiler transformations interactively.

## My Expertise
- **Security Research**: From vulnerability analysis to fuzzing and reversing engineering.
- **Compiler Verification**: Techniques like SMT-based validation and logic-based program verification.
- **Programming Languages**: C/C++, OCaml, Swift, JavaScript, x86/64 Assembly.
- **Languages**: Fluent in **Korean** (Native) and proficient in **English** (B2).

## Achievements
- Reported vulnerability in major systems: **Microsoft Windows**, **Samsung Galaxy**, **McAfee Antivirus**, **HP**, **Acer**, etc.

## Personal Interests
- Exploring new methodologies for **automated bug detection**.
- Engaging with **program analysis** and advancing **compiler testing techniques**.
- Staying curious about the interplay of **logic and programming languages**.
